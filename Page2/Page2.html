        <h2>A Brief History of Skateboarding</h2>
        <p>The history of Skateboarding is fairly recent. Its origins had a modest beginning in the 1950s when kids took
            the wheels off of roller skates and put them on a 2x4 wooden board. Usually this was accompanied with a
            wooden handlebar making it look more like a scooter but nonetheless, this was a skateboard in its infancy.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>Surfers were the first to adopt the skateboard in large use during Surfing’s off-season on the West Coast.
            The 1950s brought with it tons of cement and thus roads were better equipped for the skateboard. Surfers
            were given the nickname “Cement Surfers” because they were often seen “surfing” down roads and sidewalks.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>The Surfers were the first to make improvements to the skateboard; often times they took smaller surfboards
            and equipped them with homemade trucks and wheel bearings. Beginning in the mid 60s, skateboards had begun
            to be commercialized and mass produced allowing more kids to use them.</p>
        <br>
        <p>The first skate competition was in 1963 and it showed off the various tricks skaters had learned showing a
            new side of skating. Before, skateboards were just used to get around town but now they were beginning to be
            used to show true skill. Skaters started to use empty swimming pools to perform tricks which was the
            foundation for the modern skatepark.</p>
        <br>
        <p>Skating took off in the late 60s where the modern roots really started to grow. Different brands started to
            make accessories which were previously unheard of. The company Vans for example which makes skate shoes, was
            founded in 1966 and is still a staple shoe for skaters today.

        <h3>What Age Groups Is Skateboarding Suitable For?</h3>
        <p>Skateboarding is a sport that discriminates no age group, that being said you should assess your level of
            fitness and stability. Skateboarding is usually safe for children aged 6 and above, with adult supervision
            and the correct skateboard protection such as helmets, knee and elbow pads. Similarly, skateboarding is not
            just for kids, adult skateboards are extremely popular with many adults building their own as opposed to
            buying complete skateboards. If you are new to skateboarding and want to learn a little more, here is a
            quick beginners guide to skateboarding.</p>
