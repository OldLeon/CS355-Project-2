                    How Much Does a New Board Cost?
                </h3>

                <p class="faq-text">
                    You can buy complete "toy" skateboards, made in places like Taiwan, in the appropriate shops. Here
                    we're talking about the cost of what we would call a "real" skateboard, all of them made in the USA.
                    There is a vast difference in terms of performance. Australia = $AUS 300 for a complete good quality
                    US set-up.
                    USA = around US$100.
                    UK = about UKP 120+.
                    Everywhere else on the planet = probably the same as Australia.

                    Stuff you get for free. The US stuff is generally the best to go with, by "real" companies. For
                    locally produced stuff, best to ask a local skater.

                    Should I get Wood or Slick?
                </h3>
                <p class="faq-text">
                    Wood decks are made out of plain maple laminates. Slick boards have a layer of slippery plastic
                    bonded to the bottom.

                    <br>
                    You can have just wood, but not just the slick part. Slick on wood if you require extra
                    slide/strength. Slick decks are usually heavier than wood ones. Current preference of most serious
                    skaters is for wood these days. It also works out cheaper.

                    What is the difference between ramp and street skating?
                </h3>
                <p class="faq-text">
                    Ramp skating happens on ramps, while street skating happens just about everywhere else except pools,
                    concrete parks, slalom courses, roller rinks, contest freestyle areas, etc. Unless of course there
                    is a bench or some other obstacle nearby. Street skating, despite its name, rarely happens on
                    streets. The things you actually skate while street skating are pretty hard for cars and stuff to
                    get at.
